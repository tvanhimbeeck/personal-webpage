Physicist working in the field of Quantum Information theory.

[Personal Bio in construction]
<!-- I'm interested Quantum Cryptography and building new mathematical tools for characterising the security of practical protocols. My main research theme is build the link with the field of Convex Optimisation. -->

<!-- # I'm interested in both numerical and analytical solutions (with the intuition that both problems are closely linked); in different Adversarial models (ie. (semi-)-Device-(In)Dependent protocols) -->

<!-- # keywords: Quantum optics, Quantum Key Distribution, Device-Independent Cryptography -->
